            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
            <p>Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) are marsupials native to Australia, known for their fluffy ears, large noses, and teddy bear-like appearance. They are mostly found in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia. Koalas feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients and toxic to most animals, but koalas have a specialized digestive system that allows them to process this tough diet. Because of this low-energy diet, koalas sleep up to 18–22 hours a day to conserve energy. Baby koalas, called joeys, develop in their mother’s pouch for about six months before emerging. Koalas are solitary and territorial animals. Their populations are threatened by habitat destruction, bushfires, disease (especially chlamydia), and climate change, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
