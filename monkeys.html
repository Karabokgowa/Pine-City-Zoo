            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
            <p>Monkeys are intelligent, social primates found in various regions around the world, including Africa, Asia, Central and South America. They are generally divided into two groups: Old World monkeys, which live in Africa and Asia (like baboons and macaques), and New World monkeys, found in the Americas (like capuchins and howler monkeys). Monkeys vary widely in size, behavior, and habitat, from tree-dwelling species to those that live mostly on the ground. Most monkeys have long tails, with New World monkeys often having prehensile tails that help them grip branches. They are omnivores, feeding on fruits, leaves, insects, and small animals. Monkeys are highly social animals, living in troops with complex communication systems that include vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. Their intelligence and adaptability make them fascinating creatures, but many species are threatened by habitat destruction, hunting, and the illegal pet trade.
