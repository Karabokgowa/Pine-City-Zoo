            <h3>GIRRAFES</h3>
            <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the tallest land animal on Earth, easily recognized by its extremely long neck and legs, distinctive spotted coat, and large, expressive eyes. Native to the savannas and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, giraffes use their long necks to browse leaves, especially from acacia trees, which are often out of reach for other herbivores. Despite having such long necks, giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as humans—just seven—each greatly elongated. They are social animals, often found in loose herds without strong social bonds. Giraffes have excellent eyesight and can spot predators like lions from a great distance, and they can defend themselves with powerful kicks. Although not considered endangered, some subspecies are vulnerable due to habitat loss and poaching, prompting conservation efforts across Africa. </p>
