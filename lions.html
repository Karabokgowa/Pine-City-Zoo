            <h3>LIONS</h3>
            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most iconic and powerful big cats in the world, often referred to as the "king of the jungle," though it primarily inhabits grasslands and savannas rather than jungles. Native to parts of Africa and a small population in India (Asiatic lions), lions are unique among big cats for their social behavior, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. Lions are apex predators, hunting large herbivores like zebras, buffalo, and wildebeest, with females usually doing most of the hunting. Males are known for their impressive manes, which vary in color and size and serve as a sign of strength and maturity. Lions spend much of their time resting, often sleeping up to 20 hours a day. While they once roamed across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, lion populations have drastically declined due to habitat loss, human conflict, and poaching, making conservation efforts critical to their survival.</p>
