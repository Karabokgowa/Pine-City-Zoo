            <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
            <p>Elephants, the largest land mammals, are easily recognizable by their massive size, large ears, and long trunks. They are found in Africa and Asia, with two main species: the African elephant (including savanna and forest elephants) and the Asian elephant. African elephants have larger ears and longer front legs than hind legs, while Asian elephants have smaller ears, a more convex back, and a dish-shaped forehead. 
                Key Features of Elephants:
                Size and Weight:
                African savanna elephants are the largest, with adult males reaching heights of 3 meters and weights of up to 6,000 kg. 
                Tusks:
                Both male and female African elephants have tusks, while only some male Asian elephants have them. 
                Trunk:
                The trunk is a versatile organ used for smelling, feeding, bathing, and even lifting objects. 
                Ears:
                Large ears help elephants regulate their body temperature. 
                Social Structure:
                Elephants live in family groups led by a female matriarch, and they form complex social bonds. 
                Intelligence:
                Elephants are known for their intelligence and ability to exhibit complex behaviors, including grief and learning. </p>
