            <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
            <p>Gorillas are the largest primates in the world and are native to the forests of central and western Africa. There are two main species—eastern gorillas and western gorillas—each with subspecies such as the mountain gorilla and the western lowland gorilla. These intelligent and gentle animals live in tight-knit family groups led by a dominant male called a silverback, named for the silver hair on his back. Gorillas are primarily herbivores, feeding on leaves, fruits, stems, and bamboo. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Despite their strength and size, gorillas are generally peaceful unless threatened. Unfortunately, gorillas are critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, disease, and human conflict. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect their populations and habitats.</p>
