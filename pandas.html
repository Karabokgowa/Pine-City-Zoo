            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
            <p>Pandas, specifically the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), are beloved animals native to the mountainous forests of central China. Known for their distinctive black-and-white fur, pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up over 99% of their diet, although they are technically omnivores and may occasionally eat small animals or eggs. Despite their carnivorous ancestry, their bodies have adapted to digest bamboo, although not very efficiently, which is why they spend up to 12 hours a day eating. Pandas are generally solitary and have a calm, gentle nature. Female pandas give birth to one or two cubs, which are born tiny, pink, and helpless. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, giant pandas were once considered endangered, but thanks to extensive conservation efforts, their status has improved to "vulnerable." They are also an important cultural symbol in China and a global icon for wildlife conservation.
