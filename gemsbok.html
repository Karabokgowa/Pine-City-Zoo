            <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
            <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. Known for its striking appearance, the gemsbok has a light gray or tan body with bold black-and-white facial markings and long, straight, spear-like horns that can reach up to 85 centimeters in both males and females. These antelope are well-adapted to desert environments, capable of surviving high temperatures and limited water sources by obtaining moisture from the food they eat, such as grasses and desert shrubs. Gemsbok are social animals, often found in herds of 10 to 40 individuals, although solitary males are also common. 
                Their keen senses and powerful build help them evade predators like lions and hyenas. The gemsbok is also a national symbol of Namibia, featured on the countryâ€™s coat of arms.</p>
