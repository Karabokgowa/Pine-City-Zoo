            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
            <p>Warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) are wild pigs native to the grasslands, savannas, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are easily recognizable by their large, flat heads adorned with prominent facial warts—thick skin growths that protect them during fights—and impressive curved tusks that grow from their upper jaws. Warthogs are well adapted to dry environments and often use abandoned burrows, usually dug by other animals like aardvarks, for shelter and protection from predators. They are primarily herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and bark, but will occasionally eat insects and small animals. Warthogs are social animals, typically living in groups called sounders composed of females and their young, while males are more solitary. Despite their somewhat fierce appearance, warthogs are generally timid and rely on their speed and agility to escape threats such as lions, leopards, and hyenas.
